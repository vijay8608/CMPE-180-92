Use assignment 3a and 3b and show a matrix with starting number at the center and spiraling outwards in anti-clockwise direction.
In the output instead of numbers show “#” and “.” for prime and composite numbers respectively and describe the pattern if visible.

Also for extra credits, use a separate pattern of matrix and see if any other patterns are visible.

Pattern Used:

01 Diagonal Matrix like below

			1  3  6  10 15
    			2  5  9  14 19
    			4  8  13 18 22
    			7  12 17 21 24
